Negroni Boilerplate
===============

This is a forked Negroni web app with basic auth and user registrations via MySQL database

Note
----------
- Please note that this example at the current time lacks a few important security features (ie. password hashing) 
and as such should not be used in production without a lot of changes.

Features
----------
* Signup/Login
* Pages rendered from templates
* Very Simple API call via Javascript on homepage

Requirements
-----------

* Negroni
* Negroni-sessions
* Render

Configuration
--------------
Import users-mysql.sql in your MySQL database, then edit database url in main.go
Soon I'll provide a config file for settings.

To Do

* Hash passwords
* More extensive api examples
* Add a minimal CRUD
